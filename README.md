**Dataset:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bMNXMzB_47zcpub3Z0TgKBlUV0Xekx9K?usp=share_link

**Objective:**  
The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model for recognizing the characters present in number plates using object detection and transfer learning method. The model will take an image of a vehicle's number plate as input and output the recognized characters.

**Background:**  
Number plate character recognition has numerous applications such as traffic management, toll collection, and law enforcement. Object detection and transfer learning methods are widely used in computer vision tasks and can be applied to this problem. Object detection algorithms can localize the number plate in an image, while transfer learning allows the use of pre-trained models to reduce training time and increase accuracy.

**Results:**
